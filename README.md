# Hospitality-Management-Network-Design
Network project using CISCO PACKET TRACER
 

<h2>Description</h2>


 <h3>1. **Network Design Planning**:</h3>
- Define the network requirements and objectives for the hotel network system.
- Identify the network topology, including the number of floors, rooms, and devices.
- Determine the placement of networking equipment such as switches, routers, access points, and servers. 
<br />

<h3> 2. **VLAN Configuration**: </h3>
- Implement VLANs to segment the network based on different departments or functions within the hotel.
- Configure VLANs for guest Wi-Fi, staff network, management network, etc.

<h3> 3. **Inter-VLAN Routing (Router on a Stick)**: </h3>
- Set up inter-VLAN routing to allow communication between different VLANs.
- Configure a router on a stick to facilitate routing between VLANs.

<h3> 4. **DHCP Server Configuration**: </h3>
- Set up a DHCP server to dynamically assign IP addresses to devices on the network.
- Configure DHCP scopes for different VLANs.

<h3> 5. **Port Security**: </h3>
- Implement port security measures to restrict access to specific ports based on MAC addresses.
- Configure port security settings on switches to enhance network security.

<h3> 6. **SSH Configuration**: </h3>
- Enable SSH (Secure Shell) for secure remote access to networking devices.
- Configure SSH settings on routers and switches for secure management.

<h3> 7. **WLAN Configuration**: </h3>
- Set up wireless LAN (WLAN) for guest Wi-Fi and staff access.
- Configure wireless access points with SSIDs, security settings, and VLAN assignments.

<h3> 8. **Access Point Configuration**: </h3>
- Configure access points with appropriate settings such as SSID, security mode, channel, and transmit power.
- Ensure proper placement of access points for optimal coverage.

<h3> 9. **Host Configurations**: </h3>
- Configure host devices with appropriate IP settings, including IP address, subnet mask, gateway, and DNS server.
- Test connectivity between host devices and verify network functionality.

<h3> 10. **Testing and Simulation**: </h3>
- Use Cisco Packet Tracer to simulate the network design and implementation.
- Test different network scenarios to ensure proper functionality and security.
